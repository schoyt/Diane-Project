 To be more specific, Diane, about the things I need to do, I need to get my  Adderall prescription refilled. That's one thing I need to do. Another is, like I  said, apply for this Arborist test and study for that. I should go climbing again.  I should watch more movies again. You know, when I think about climbing in  movies, though, those aren't really things that like, you know, I don't know. I'll  try to think of more things that I need to do and so you can keep track.
