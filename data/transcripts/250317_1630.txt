 Diane, it's 5.30, just about March 17th. Beautiful day, about 50 degrees sunny. I'm  outside in the backyard and taking a look at this hackberry we got back here.  Diane, remind me, this year I ought to remove this metal plating on the side  of this hackberry in our backyard. It looks like it used to be a basketball  hoop. There's also some wires and ropes that are affixed to the hackberry. Looks  like they were part of something that's now been consumed. Might as well remove all  that this year. Yeah, with that I might to do for this year.
