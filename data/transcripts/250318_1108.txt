 Diane it's 12 08 p.m. I'm here at Vicky Poplins my second to last stop of the day  putting down 130 gallons though on one redbud six blue spruces two oaks and a  boxwood adding mycorrhizae and iron to that. On a side note that that hot and  spicy soup and all that Kung Pao chicken ended up being kind of  spicy and I don't have my water bottle today. Huge oversight on my part not  bringing my water bottle today huge mistake now I'm thirsty might have to  rush through this and grab a Gatorade or something real quick I'll let you know  what's up
