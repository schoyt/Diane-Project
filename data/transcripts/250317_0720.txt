 Diane, it's now 8.20 a.m. I am at David and Lynn Steele's house to do an  Arbor Health fertilization on three pinnokes directly across from the house  in the island it says. It looks like there's one tree that's been cut down  so it'll probably only be two pinnokes. Hopefully the customer is here and I  can talk to him. Get clarification but putting down 60 gallons should be  pretty straightforward.
