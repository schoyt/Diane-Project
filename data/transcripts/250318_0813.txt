 I don't believe I mentioned Diane. This first stop is a customer named Dustin McKinley.  I'm here to put 55 gallons of Arbor Health Down on a river birch front left, choke cherry  front left, and front right. So that's two choke cherries, two bald cypresses in the  back, and a maple front right corner.
