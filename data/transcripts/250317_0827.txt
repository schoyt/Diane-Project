 I treated the Maipa at Elsa Bells. Right as I was wrapping up, about to close the gate,  a couple dogs got let out, a big one and a little one. And the big one ran out. His name  was Bowie. I told the owner and stuck around for a little while. Bowie was just running  around the neighbor's houses and after a little while the guy was able to get him.  So that's resolved, but make a note that there is a dog at this property and to make sure  that we have client confirmation or we just don't leave the gate open.
