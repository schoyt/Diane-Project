 The kung pao chicken is pretty good, I'd give it like a three and a half out of five.  The egg roll is alright, I haven't tried the hot and sour soup yet that came with it, but  for $7.75, I think all said and done it was about $10 plus tip, for the price the quality  and quantity of the meal is you can't beat it.  I really got to hit up more Asian spots, I just went with the kung pao chicken, I can never  remember what I like from these Asian spots, so hopefully now that I have you Diane, I should  be able to remember a little more about what I like and don't like.  Yeah, I got to hit up more Asian spots and develop my tastes and preferences.  Also I'm about to head to an address on Ashland Avenue, and it makes me want to play Morrowind,  I know I talked about how it's a bad habit, I need to play less Morrowind, but I can't  stop thinking about it, I feel like the only way to really get over it is to power  through.
