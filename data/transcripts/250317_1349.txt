 Diane it's 2 49 p.m. March 17th. I finished up my route and I'm stomping  for lunch at a place called Steak Escape Sandwich Grill. Looks like a  filly cheese steak spot. I got the regular size grand escape in order of  fries and a drink. Total came out to 14.69. It's $14.69. I'll have to let  you know how it is. It's got rave reviews and you know me. I love a good filly  cheese steak, but we'll see if it meets my standards.
