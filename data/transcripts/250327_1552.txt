 Diane it's early spring and the honeysuckle is starting to bud and leaf out again  One of my favorite times a year because it puts a huge target on their back and lets me know exactly who I got to kill  I just got to get outside. I got to get outside in the coming weeks with a hearty pair of gloves and yank of those suckers up  I  Got a few big purchases. I got to make this year by the end of the year by the fall  I got to get a chainsaw because fall is really  honeysuckle  chainsawing season  So you can apply the the cut stump herbicide  Although I could just do it like in the middle of summer which might be  In mid-summer would be a great time to start killing honeysuckle. I  Need to rank these purchases in order of priority chainsaw bike  Ah shit, what was the other one?  Damn oh, I want a camera chainsaw bike  Camera is I okay?  Let me let me rank these right now bike is probably most top priority because I want to be able to ride the bike  As soon as possible then chainsaw because I need it by mid-summer and I can't even remember the other one camera  That would actually be nice to have sooner than later because I  Mean I mean there's always good things to take a picture of so maybe camera second maybe camera first  No bike first bike is it cheaper. I can find that at a pawn shop  Anyway, I  Need to get outside and kill this honeysuckle  I've been yanking them up on clients properties when they're real little I can just yank them up and  The ground's kind of wet right now. It might be a good time to get out there and yank something out  But uh, yeah, just wanted to go in a little anti honeysuckle rant  Because this thing sucks
