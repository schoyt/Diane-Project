 Diane it's 9-11 a.m. March 18th. I'm beginning my route for the day. Pretty  late start getting out here but I'm down near Greenwood so I've only got six stops  but today's probably gonna be a lot of drive time. Yeah really not much work to  do but must even out on the drive time. Hopefully I got off early. I can take  a nap. I did not sleep very much last night. I stayed up too late  playing Morrowind until like almost one in the morning. Bad habit. I need to work on  that. I got plans to go biking with Mimi later. I'm gonna rent a bike and bike  around. That should be fun. I don't know if I ever got back to you about that  steak escape I had yesterday. It was it was quite good. Next time I'd get it  without the lettuce maybe without the tomato. I just think you know the  fresh ingredients kind of make the much more you know how it is. Anyway no lettuce  next time but pretty decent for the price. I'd also get a small fry instead of a  regular fry but steak escape is a good cheese steak place. Yeah just starting  the day out. I'll let you know how it goes.
