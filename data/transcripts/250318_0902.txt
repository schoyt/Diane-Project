 Diane it's 10 a.m. I'm at the second stop just as I suspected the drive time is  really what's eaten through my day looks like there's probably 15 minutes of  drive time at least between each of these stops but I've only got eight  I've actually I counted it out I actually don't have eight stops I only  have six stops so something's got to account for my day anyway I'm here at  John Sutton's house putting 40 gallons of arbor health plus iron down on these  three white pines on the back right foundation keep thinking about twin  peaks we finished firewalk with me last night and started the return I I feel  like maybe I messed up I should have given Calvin and Alex more time to  just kind of sit with firewalk with me before we started the return but  whatever you know oh god I just noticed some of this neighborhood right outside  this guy's house they're growing honeysuckle is like a little ornamental  bush that's fucking disgusting
