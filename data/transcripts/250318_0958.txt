 Diane, it's 10.58 a.m. I've stopped for lunch at a place called egg roll number one.  I know it's a little early for lunch, but I am hungry.  And I've been craving some Chinese food or Asian food or whatever for a while.  Got the Kung Pao chicken, totally up to $8.45.  I'll have to let you know how it is.
