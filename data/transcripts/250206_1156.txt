 Diane, it is 1157, February 6th. I've been up for about an hour and a half now, but I haven't really done anything yet.  I really need to get on a routine with, um, you know, writing in my journal and also this Fabrica app on my desktop and also on my phone.  I need to start cooking for myself. I think that that would be, you know, a healthy part of any routine.  Um, I need to just start, yeah, like getting my lifestyle, like, tailored.  Like, I'd like to have a coffee machine in my room so that I can wake up and have coffee already ready for me.  I'd like to get those shelves up by the end of the month, which means I really need to start looking at what kind of wood I'm going to use and  really, I guess that's about it. Maybe a stain or something, but, um, yeah, I've been so focused on this like AI project this past week.  Um, and it's like, I really want to get it done. So it's good that I'm focused on it, but also, um, you know, I don't want to let the rest of my life languish.  So today, uh, I'm going to do some laundry, maybe try to tidy up my mess of a room.  And later on, I think I might hang out with Zach Eisenhart.  I'll have to let you know how he's doing.  Um, yeah, the roommates are getting back into video games.  I'm trying not to get back into video games because I know that when I do, it's going to just suck me in and I'm going to get nothing done again.  So maybe I can try to just be productive for the rest of the month.  And then when I go back to work, I'll, uh, I'll be able to play some video games after work.  Anyway, yep. So today nothing's happened really yet. I'll keep you posted as things happen.
