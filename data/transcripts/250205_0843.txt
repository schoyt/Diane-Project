 Diane, it's 8.45 a.m. February 5th. I'm on my way home, stayed the night at Mimi's last  night after my Alina. It was pretty fun. I had a great time. We watched some Strangers  with Candy. That is a really funny show. I gotta watch that more. I gotta put everyone  onto Strangers with Candy. Yep, just headed back home now. Gonna work more on the AI  project today. And we'll see.
