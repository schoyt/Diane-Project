 Diane, over the weekend I worked on the Diane project and I'm happy to say that I finished  phase 2, so now on phase 3 I need to upload a massive selection of audio files and test  how that goes.  So it seems like the next step is to get in the habit of taking these voice notes  every day and then I'll have a lot of data to work with.  So I'm going to try to include only important information, but also who knows what's important.  So anyway, throughout the day today, which is March 17th, Diane, March 17th is today,  I'm going to try to record as much audio as I can.
