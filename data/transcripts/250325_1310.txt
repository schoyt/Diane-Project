 Diane, it's roughly 2.10 p.m. Tuesday, March 25th.  I have been recovering from a little bout of, I'm pretty sure it's food poisoning.  I think that the general sows in that I had on Sunday may have done me in.  I can't say for certain it may have been a couple other things but I think the general  sows in may have, may have fucked me up so I missed work yesterday was up all  night Sunday night throwing up and shitting no good but back at work today  nice easy day getting off and it's starting to rain yeah just been not  not feeling good hopefully I'll get back in the swing of things now that I'm  kind of recovered from the food poisoning but I still got a sore throat from  all the throwing up I did and just generally sore really sore a little  lethargic a little bummed out that should hopefully go away as the week  continues yeah I feel like luckily I'm maybe getting burnt out a little bit on  more wind which will hopefully result in me doing some productive things again I  also need to get in the habit of recording these voice memos and I  finally got a upload all of the audio and begin on phase four of the Diane  project but yeah it's just been a rough rough past few days feel bad I'm probably  gonna go home and just take a nap or something I'll keep you posted on how  I am but yeah let's keep in mind that general sows in is no good never eat  there again it kind of you know I was saying that I really need to get on my  Chinese food game because it's so affordable I'm not so certain about  that anymore seems like it may be a little risky but yeah so headed home now  and yeah
