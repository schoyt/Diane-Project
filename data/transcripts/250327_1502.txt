 Diane it's 4 o 2 p.m. March 27th. I met my parents house and watching the dogs  it's really great to see him I love Reggie and Lulu and I've been missing  him a lot I feel like I just haven't been around haven't visited much recently  and it's nice to see him it's nice to be home. Charlie I was taking mom and dad  on a trip to Vegas to see the Grateful Dead at the Sphere. It's fucking awesome and  I'm really happy that my parents and my brother are getting to experience that  but I'm also really jealous like I'm really jealous that like you know like  I want to be in a position where I can give my family gifts like that I want  to be in a position where I can just take my parents on a trip to go do  something that they love like I'm just scared that I'm never gonna get to that  point and I'm gonna be 31 next month and going into 30 I've been thinking like  you know this next year my first year as like a 30 year old this is what it's  gonna be like to be 30 like this is how I'm going to act when I'm 30 and in big  part I think I've done a really great job like I think that I've I've done  so much this past year to work on myself you know like making this this whole the  Diane project I still haven't finished it we'll see if I can finish it but it's  like that's great I feel like I'm you know more healthy and active and I'm  I feel like I'm better in my romantic relationship but there's still so much  that I need to work on and I'm happy to be working on it but I just like  I want to be able to take my family on a trip I want to be able to do fun stuff  and it's also like the world is ending you know so it's like I I feel like I  could really hit my stride and figure things out but by the time I do that it's  just gonna be a completely different world and I just I don't know how to  really live in this world you know like it I just feel like I'm not really made  for this this bullshit like it's just it's also frivolous it's also meaningless  and I don't feel suicidal or anything like I want to live like that's what I'm  upset about is that I want to live I decidedly do not want to die but I just  feel like this life that that humans have carved out for ourselves it's just  so it just doesn't make any sense to me why have we done this why is there  garbage all over the place why do we work so much and just fill our world  with garbage and we don't have any time to do anything and you know people I feel  like I don't know yeah I'm just not I don't understand I don't know how I'm  gonna find my niche how I'm gonna like make my money and I don't want to have  to worry about making money and I think that's why I haven't made money it's just  not something that I worry about but I want to get to the point where I'm  making money so that I can like really stop worrying about it you know so I can  like if I just make seventy thousand dollars a year like holy shit that's  like I can't imagine living a life that lavish you know but by the time I get  to seventy thousand it's gonna be like seventy thousand might as well be thirty  thousand you know I don't even know what kind of world I should be preparing  for and it's like I should just be enjoying it while it lasts but I don't  know I'm working all the time and also my friendship so I just I like I  haven't talked to Jeremy and Lexi in a while I want to hang out with them you  know I don't hit up Kevin enough I I don't have Nathaniel enough Daniel reached  out to me on his little jail app I haven't gotten back to him but I feel  even like guilt for neglecting that friendship even though you know like I  shouldn't be friends with him and I've actually been really happy to not have him  in my life anymore but yeah I turn 31 next month and I've just been reflecting on  you know I want to see what more I can get done in these next few weeks while  I'm still 30 while I'm still able to be like yeah I did that you know the  first year I turned 30 I did I started doing this for myself and I made a  big difference you know and I know it's just numbers it's like 31 is the same as  30 and 40 is gonna be the same as 30 and I got so much time but the future is so  uncertain I don't know what what's gonna what it's gonna be like in a year or  much less 10 years you know so a lot of uncertainty a lot of  anxiety I'm not feeling like terrible about it not nearly as bad as I felt in  the past about things like I think I'm taking it all in stride you know I'm  gonna stick around no matter what but it's just a bummer it's just because  like we all got to stick around no matter what why are we making this such  a hell for ourselves and I'm repeating myself at this point  I'm watching the dogs but I really probably need to go home and work on  something productive you know we're like I just I feel like I'm in a funk  and I need to do something to lift my spirits back up so I'll keep you posted on  that
