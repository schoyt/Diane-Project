 Diane, it is 6.45pm. I am on my way to the Can Can walking over there to see The Brutalist  starring Adrian Brody. I'm preparing for a very long movie. It's like almost four hours  long so it's going to be the whole rest of my night is watching this movie. But I've  heard it's really good. We'll see. Stay tuned for my review. Yeah, walking over it's  kind of a rainy, drizzly evening. Not too bad. Not too cold. It's kind of pretty. Yeah, I'm  going to go get some of those buns from the Can Can. I'll have to keep the update on how  much that costs and how they are. Yep.
