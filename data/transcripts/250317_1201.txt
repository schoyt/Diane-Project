 Diane, I'm standing outside of Danny Oclac's house looking at this linden tree  I'm here to treat. Upon first examination it is very  cankerous and closer examination reveals these are exit holes I guess you'd call  of a fungus. I identified it on iNaturalist as, what is this, flammulina  velutipes or velvet foot but it says it's an Asian species of fungus so I have my  doubts I think that it may just not be grown enough to get an accurate reading  but then again I don't really know much about the invasion ecology of fungi  that might be something to look more into. This tree is looking totally  fucked. I have a suspicion that any fertilizer I put on this tree is just  going to prolong its life but its life is ending. Yeah, remind me to look more  into wood-eating funguses. What kind would grow on a linden and reference  back to the iNaturalist post that I have.
