 Diane, in a moment of weakness, I have purchased a vape, one of those Miami Mint geek bars.  I think this was a bad decision, but we'll find out how bad, I guess.  I'll keep you posted on how I feel throughout the day.  I have a feeling that this thing is going to make me feel just fucking horrible.  And it'll be good to know how it makes me feel.
