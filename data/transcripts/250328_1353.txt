 2.53 p.m. March 28th. I was driving down the road, driving down right near Big  Dan's Burgers. I forget what street this is. And I passed the trailer park. I saw  as I was driving up, it was... these two guys were throwing wood into this giant  wood pile. And they were standing in the bed of this truck. But as I got closer, I  realized that it wasn't really a truck, it was just a truck bed. It was the white  bed of a pickup truck with the back wheels on it. But the front of it  wasn't a truck, it was like being supported by a forklift. And as I  was checking that out, then I turned... this is all happening within the span  of seconds. I see these guys throwing this wood into this pile. I examine  their setup and then I look at the guys and they're not guys at all. They're  like children. Well, they're boys. They're like maybe like 13 years old. They  couldn't have been older than like 13. And the strange part was that they  were both facing me, like looking me in the eyes with their arms like they're  waving at me. Their arms were in like right angles. They were waving at me like  in synchronicity. And it's like why were they... why were they waving at me? How  did they see me coming up? Were they waving at everybody? It felt like a  dream. It felt... not normal. I can't explain it other than that. One of the  boys looked like Maui from Portland. And the other was like a blonde kid. And the  mixed kid was wearing a red shirt. Strange image. The wood pile was really tall. It  was like in a... had a little shelter above it. Like it must have been the  wood for the whole trailer park. These little boys were stacking wood for this  trailer park. All very lynchian. Very twin-peeksy when I think about it. Just  had to record that.
