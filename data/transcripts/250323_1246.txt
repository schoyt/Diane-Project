 Diane, it is 1.46 p.m. March 23rd. I've really fallen off on using the recording  device and keeping notes. Something I should work on. I just get into a mood  where I'm not in the mood and then I just lose my momentum. But about to go  get some lunch. I think I'm gonna go to this place called General Sows Inn.  Get some Szechuan chicken. I'll have to let you know how it is.  I've been playing too much Morrowind lately. I love it. It's really fun. But I've just got  some other things I need to do. I'd rather be reading or playing my new synth that I got. Got  a new synth. So that's cool and fun. But I need to really sit down and learn how to use it  and play around with it. Yeah. Just trying to keep up momentum on the Diane project as well.  But I feel pulled in many different directions. I gotta apply to the ISA test and that is a headache.  Then I got to study for that test. And all that.  And I want to get a new job. But that can probably wait. And that can wait till after  I get my ISA certification. Then I can look for a job. But yeah, I got a lot I need to do.  And I need to stop playing so much Morrowind. But it is fun.
