 All right, Diane, I'm at my last stop of the day, Ava Smith here to do an Arbor  kelp, no Arbor health fertilization on two oak and two maples, 50 gallons with  sulfur, sulfur. Last job of the day and I'm doing it with sulfur so I'm gonna  have to run a bunch of water afterwards otherwise it's gonna gunk up my tank and  stuff turns to paint. I've been taking my sweet time today, it's probably gonna, I'll  probably get done around 3, 3.15 I bet, so just about a full day, you can probably  time it and get my full eight hours. Anyway, last stop.
