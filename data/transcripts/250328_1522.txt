 I'm looking at the spring down at my family's property and it's all covered with, it looks  like diarrhea, it looks awful, but maybe it's healthy, I'd love to test the water sometime  this year and figure out what the viability is that it could be turned into some kind of  ecosystem, some kind of habitat for maybe salamanders or something like that, because right now it  just looks like a mosquito breeding pond, but I bet if we dug it out a little bit, kind  of deepened it, allowed more water to pool, maybe we'd get some kind of life other than  just algae skimming the surface, I don't know, maybe there's stuff down there, but it doesn't  look like it looks dead and gross, but yeah, remind me to look into that sometime this  year.
