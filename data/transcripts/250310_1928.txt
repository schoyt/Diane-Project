 Diane, I've just purchased some weed from a gas station and BP next to the hotel about  a ten minute walk.  Not too bad.  Smoking it right now and it's fine.  I don't know.  It's a gas station weed.  Three pre-rolled joints for twelve dollars.  Two grams each.  That's grams for twelve dollars the weed has got to be shitty, but that's too good a deal.  So I don't know, we'll see if I get high, but you know, maybe it'll itch my itch for  me.  I'm just going to head back to the hotel, call it an early night, and maybe watch some  family guy or something.
