 Diane it's 11 23 a.m. I've just arrived at Jim Fields house my fifth on paper my  fifth stop of the day. The hot and sour soup from Agro number one not bad you  know not an unpleasant thing maybe not the most flavorful hot and sour soup I've  ever had but nothing unpleasant about it. I think it's all around probably a  pretty solid three and a half star experience except the Agro the Agro was  kind of the weak point which is surprising from a place you know called  Agro number one excuse me. Anyway I'm here at Jim Jim Fields house to fertilize the  row of Arbor Vides on the right of his driveway. These Arbor Vides I know them  well I accidentally sprayed this man Jim Field one time with Dithane while I was  spraying these Arbor Vides. Anyway yeah putting down 35 gallons should be pretty  straightforward.
