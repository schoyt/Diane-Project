 I have an idea for the praise GDD project. I would like it to be able to be  used by people who want to grow native plants from seed. So I'd like to, in the  phenomenological context section or the phenomenological data whatever, I'd like  there to be another tab where you can see what species are in flower if they're in  seed and then times of year to plant those seeds and when they would grow and all  that kind of thing. I think that would be really neat. It would definitely make the  project a lot more extensive but it would also make it a lot more useful  and probably a lot more popular.
