 Diane, I'm outside of Pat Jeannette's house here to fertilize both maple trees, one next  to a lamppost, one in front of Spruce Tree's left of driveway, and all boxwoods in the front,  left and right of door, a long foundation between drive and river birch, and both maple  trees in the back.  Add manganese and iron, putting down 70 gallons.  All right.
