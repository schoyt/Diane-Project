 Diane it's 9 0 6 a.m. March 28th. Off to a pretty good start this morning. Just  finished up my second stop out of 12. 10 fertilizations to disease sprays. We'll  see if the disease sprays happen. Apparently it's supposed to be pretty  windy later on. It's supposed to be 77 degrees today as the high. So after  work I might hang out with Mimi, might go on a hike in Eagle Creek or do something.  I'm not sure yet, but should be a beautiful if overcast day. And yeah I'll  let you know how things go.
