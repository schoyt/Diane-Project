 Diane, I have 12 stops on my route today. It is 753 March 17th, 753 a.m. that is, Diane.  I just arrived at my first stop, James Reed. I'm here to treat three service berries in  the back at the property line with Arbor Health. I think I see them. A little strange  for service berries. They look like they're all single stem. I need to do a walk around  to make sure, but yep.
