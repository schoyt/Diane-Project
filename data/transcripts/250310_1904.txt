 Diane it's 8.04 p.m. March 10th. I just got to Dayton, Ohio for this liquid you  work thing the drive wasn't so bad with Grant wasn't nearly as bad as it's been  before actually kind of nice but I've realized that I don't have any weed  stuff with me I could have sworn I bought like probably two weed things with me but  apparently I have none so I really need to find some weed now that I'm here or it  will be a hellish few days I'll have to let you know how it is but liquid you  time again this year we'll see how it goes all right
