 Diane it's 848 a.m. March 26th. I've just finished up my first stop on my route  today. Things are going pretty well. I'm staying at my parents house watching  Reggie and Lulu while they're in Las Vegas. Watching the Grateful Dead show at  the spear. I'm sure that's fucking awesome. It's my first week really  without my Adderall and to be honest it's going pretty well. I mean my morning  routine I feel like I'm able to get up and get to work without too much issue as  long as I get enough sleep and that'll be the big thing is I want to start  getting eight hours of sleep or at least seven hours of sleep. This morning  Diane I'm thinking a lot about old people. I feel like old people they need  to get out of the way. They you know they're not letting us young people. They're  not training us. They're self-conscious. They're insecure. They don't want to be  replaced by young people and I hate that about them. I feel like maybe modern  medicine has created too many old people and now our young people are just you  know I feel like none of these old people at my job are taking me under their  wing. They just need to retire. Yeah anyway I hate old people.
