 I just feel a little depressed about all the trash that I see everywhere.  Just living in this trash world.  No one seems to care and it's like you pick up the trash  and then there's more trash down the next day.  It's just like a revolving door, an endless infinite cycle of trash.  And it is depressing.  And I just feel like half of this earth is just resigned to the world ending.  And you know, of those people there are some who hope that the world is going to end.  And it's just like everything economically is so unfair and it's just getting way worse.  And I just feel like it's all coming to an end.  And I don't know what to do.  I feel like there's nothing I can really do except sit back and watch and try to pick up the trash on my own block.  But you know, there's a fucking patch of garbage the size of Texas in the Pacific Ocean.  There's nothing I can do about it.  Like there's really nothing that I can do.  And it's depressing.
