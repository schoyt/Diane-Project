 Just got out of the showing of the Brutalist, it was great, four hours long, didn't feel  that long though, I'd give it maybe like a four out of five, maybe a three and a half  four out of five, it was great, I got those six pork buns, no they weren't pork buns  they were chicken buns, they were good, I got two of the yum yum, two of the chili  crisp and two of the sweet chili, wasn't a huge fan of the yum yum sauce, all total  with the beer, the whiskey and the six buns, it's been 42.34 on those, I really  treated myself, at least I got to go to the movie for free, I just stopped  spending so much money, but Ron called me today, he's got a shift for me on  Monday so I should have a little bit of money coming in, maybe I won't have to  worry so much about pinching my pennies, but then again I'm not really worrying  about that and that's the problem, anyway yeah just walking home, nice  night, yeah it's about 11
